  GH issue number: #8341
  risk: unlikely to be activated by chance (requires a plugin)

  component: template polymorphism
  summary: template polymorphism not collecting side constrains on the
  universe level of a parameter; this is a general form of the
  previous issue about template polymorphism exploiting other ways to
  generate untracked constraints
  introduced: morally at the introduction of template polymorphism, 23
  May 2006, 9c2d70b, r8845, Herbelin
  impacted released versions: at least V8.4-V8.4pl6, V8.5-V8.5pl3,
  V8.6-V8.6pl2, V8.7.0-V8.7.1, V8.8.0-V8.8.1, V8.9.0-V8.9.1, in theory
  also V8.1-V8.1pl4, V8.2-V8.2pl2, V8.3-V8.3pl2 but not exploit found
  there yet (an exploit using a plugin to force sharing of universe
  level is in principle possible though)
  impacted development branches: all from 8.4 to 8.9 at the time of writing and suspectingly also all from 8.1 to 8.4 if a way to create untracked constraints can be found
  impacted coqchk versions: a priori all (tested with V8.4 and V8.9 which accept the exploit)
  fixed in: soon in master and V8.10.0 (PR #9918, Aug 2019, Dénès and Sozeau)
  found by: Gilbert using explicit sharing of universes, exploit found for 8.5-8.9 by Pédrot, other variants generating sharing using sections, or using ltac tricks by Sozeau, exploit in 8.4 by Herbelin and Jason Gross by adding new tricks to Sozeau's variants
  exploit: test-suite/failure/Template.v
  GH issue number: #9294
  risk: moderate risk to be activated by chance

  component: template polymorphism
  summary: using the same universe in the parameters and the
  constructor arguments of a template polymorphic inductive (using
  named universes in modern Coq, or unification tricks in older Coq)
  produces implicit equality constraints not caught by the previous
  template polymorphism fix.
  introduced: same as the previous template polymorphism bug, morally
  from V8.1, first verified impacted version V8.5 (the universe
  unification is sufficiently different in V8.4 to prevent our trick
  from working)
  fixed in: expected in 8.10.2, 8.11+beta, master (#11128, Nov 2019, Gilbert)
  found by: Gilbert
  exploit: test-suite/bugs/closed/bug_11039.v
  GH issue number: #11039
  risk: moderate risk (found by investigating #10504)

  component: universe polymorphism, asynchronous proofs

  impacted released versions: V8.5-V8.10
  impacted development branches: none
  impacted coqchk versions: immune
  fixed in: PR#10664
  found by: Pédrot
  exploit: no test
  GH issue number: none
  risk: unlikely to be triggered in interactive mode, not present in batch mode (i.e. coqc)

  component: algebraic universes
  summary: Set+2 was incorrectly simplified to Set+1
  introduced: V8.10 (with the SProp commit 75508769762372043387c67a9abe94e8f940e80a)
  impacted released versions: V8.10.0 V8.10.1 V8.10.2
  impacted coqchk versions: same
  fixed in: PR#11422
  found by: Gilbert
  exploit: see PR (custom application of Hurkens to get around the refreshing at elaboration)
  GH issue number: see PR
  risk: unlikely to be triggered through the vernacular (the system "refreshes" algebraic
    universes such that +2 increments do not appear), mild risk from plugins which manipulate
    algebraic universes.

  component: primitive projections, guard condition
  summary: check of guardedness of extra arguments of primitive projections missing

There were otherwise several bugs in beta-releases, from memory, bugs with beta versions of primitive projections or template polymorphism or native compilation or guard (e7fc96366, 2a4d714a1).

There were otherwise maybe unexploitable kernel bugs, e.g. 2df88d83 (Require overloading), 0adf0838 ("Univs: uncovered bug in strengthening of opaque polymorphic definitions."), 5122a398 (#3746 about functors), #4346 (casts in VM), a14bef4 (guard condition in 8.1), 6ed40a8 ("Georges' bug" with ill-typed lazy machine), and various other bugs in 8.0 or 8.1 w/o knowing if they are critical.
