History and recent changes
==========================

This chapter is divided in two parts.  The first one is about the
:ref:`early history of Coq <history>` and is presented in
chronological order.  The second one provides :ref:`release notes
about recent versions of Coq <changes>` and is presented in reverse
chronological order.  When updating your copy of Coq to a new version
(especially a new major version), it is strongly recommended that you
read the corresponding release notes.  They may contain advice that
will help you understand the differences with the previous version and
upgrade your projects.
